# Frequency Analysis of Words

The script accepts text file as a parameter, loads data from the file, counts frequency of the words in the text 
and outputs to console the list of the 10 most frequent words with frequency descending.

# Quickstart

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash

$ python3 lang_frequency.py w.txt
```
where `w.txt` - text file to be analyzed.

```

Output example:
The 10 most frequently used words in the w.txt are: ['the', 'a', 'to', 'is', 'in', 'of', 'd', 'and', 'for', '3']
```
