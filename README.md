# Frequency Analysis of Words

The script accepts text file as a parameter, loads data from the file, counts frequency of the words in the text 
and outputs to console the list of the 10 most common words with their frequencies .

# Quickstart

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash

$ python3 lang_frequency.py w.txt
```
where `w.txt` - text file to be analyzed.

Output example:
```Most сommon words in the w.txt are (word, frequency):
и...................56 
вы..................49 
не..................42 
что.................40 
в...................29 
а...................19 
то..................19 
но..................17 
на..................17 
с...................16
```
